For the program corresponding to Q3 : 


1.  To calculate spatial derivative in Fourier space and evolve using Euler explicit, choose option 0

2.  To implement the second-order implicit BDF/AB scheme, choose option 2

3.  To select the number of nodes in the grid, select 1 for 128 nodes, 2 for 254 nodes and 3 for 384 nodes respectively.


Thank you!

ENJOY :) ;P
